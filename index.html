      Brain implants electrically stimulate, block or record (or both record and stimulate simultaneously) signals from single neurons or groups of neurons
      (biological neural networks) in the brain. The blocking technique is called intra-abdominal vagal blocking.
      This can only be done where the functional associations of these neurons are approximately known.
      Because of the complexity of neural processing and the lack of access to action potential related signals using neuroimaging techniques,
      the application of brain implants has been seriously limited until recent advances in neurophysiology and computer processing power.
      Much research is also being done on the surface chemistry of neural implants in effort to design products
      which minimize all negative effects that an active implant can have on the brain, and that the body can have on the function of the implant. 
      Researchers are also exploring a range of delivery systems, such as using veins, to deliver these implants without brain surgery; by leaving the skull sealed shut,
      patients could receive their neural implants without running as great a risk of seizures, strokes, or permanent neural impairments,
      all of which can be caused by open-brain surgery.
